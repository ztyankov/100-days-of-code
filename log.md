# 100 Days of Code - Log - Zdravko Tyankov

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on *[January 1, Friday, 2021]*.

#### âš¡ I will code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days

## Day 0: January 1, 2021

**Time Spent:** 1h

**Today's Progress**

- Went over the rules and guidelines for the 100 days of code challenge.
- Forked the Log repo and started my own log.
- Came up with a list of goals:
    - Learn Svelte by building sample projects.
    - Improve React.js skills by building sample projects.
    - Learn and experiment with server side rendering frameworks and technologies.
    - Work on a personal project idea about building habits.

**Thoughts:** I'm trying to get into the habit of learning and experimenting with technologies, tools and frameworks that I don't get to use in my day-to-day work. This sounds like a good way of achieving that goal. This is sprint 0. Let's see how things go. I don't know how I feel about tweeting about this challenge every day though.
