## Day 14: Friday, 01/15/2021

**Time Spent:** 1h30m

**Today's Progress**

- I learned about Svelte stores (readable/writable) and how easy they are to use.
- I learned about Svelte animations and how to make a custom one.
- Created a custom spinning animation by using Svelte's animation API that manipulates the content until the animation has settled.

## Day 12: Wednesday, 01/13/2021

**Time Spent:** 1h

**Today's Progress**

- I found some good resources with Svelte tutorials and videos
- I learned about Actions and how they can be re-used across components

## Day 11: Tuesday, 01/12/2021

**Time Spent:** 1h30m

**Today's Progress**

- I spent more time playing with TailwindCSS, reading the documentation and understanding what customizations are available
- Finished styling a card component that resembles Material UI
- Updated the TailwindCSS config file with custom colors and fonts

**Thoughts:** TailwindCSS provides a lot of options and functionality. With some practice, I should be able to get creative. The whole framework is very customizable. I was able to extend and add new colors options.

## Day 10: Monday, 01/11/2021

**Time Spent:** 1h

**Today's Progress**

- I watched some videos about Svelte actions and how you can replace regular event listeners with actions for re-usability

**Thoughts:** Actions are pretty cool. I just need to find the right situation to use them.

## Day 9: Sunday, 01/10/2021

**Time Spent:** 3h

**Today's Progress**

- I got the Snowpack + Svelte + TS + TailwindCSS template up and running after updating my Node.js version
- Started creating a clone of a Material UI card with TailwindCSS styles

**Thoughts:** Since I was able to get this Snowpack setup running, I decided to spend more time learning TailwindCSS. Initially things were a bit confusing, because you need to apply a lot of different classes to create some layouts. The approach seems interesting, so I'll try to replace my Material UI components with TailwindCSS ones.

## Day 8: Saturday, 01/09/2021

**Time Spent:** 4h

**Today's Progress**

- I tested out the cool new FE build tool called 'Snowpack'.
- I was able to get the basic setup running with Snowpack, Svelte and Typescript.
- I couldn't find a way to add PostCSS and the Svelte Material UI library to the mix. It looks like there are some outstanding issues with Snowpack that have to be resolved before I can fully migrate to it.

**Thoughts:** Running Svelte + TS with Snowpack was wicked fast. But I hit many roadblocks on the way to adding PostCSS and Svelte Material to the mix. I found multiple bug reports about some of the issues. I tried configurations from other templates as well like Svelte-Tailwind or Snowpack-PostCSS-Webpack.

## Day 7: Friday, 01/08/2021

**Time Spent:** 2h10m

**Today's Progress**

- Created a generic and encapsulated filter component that can take an arbitrary set of values and notify the parent component of a selection
- Added more filters to my meal planner app
- Added media to the meal cards and made them look more refined
- Figured out how to apply a class to custom components with the `:global()` modifier

**Thoughts:** It was nice to create re-usable, standalone component for the filters. I used some CSS variables to dynamically update the styles and content in the new component. I'm getting better at styling the Material UI components inside Svelte. Today I also learned about image placeholder services like Placeholder.com. And I played around with some grid layouts and configurations.

## Day 6: Thursday, 01/07/2021

**Time Spent:** 1h15m

**Today's Progress**

- Explore Material UI component customization through built-in mdc variables and inline styles
- Change design and colors for the filter container

**Thoughts:** Material UI components are not easy to customize. Even though some of them accept CSS classes, those classes don't appear to take effect. I might need to look into other UI systems to use that are more customizable. I wonder if Tailwind CSS would be fun to use for this project. Found Smelte, a UI framework built on top of Svelte and Tailwind CSS using Material specs.

## Day 6: Wednesday, 01/06/2021 - Skipped :(

**Thoughts:** I just couldn't muster any energy at the end of a long work day to do more coding. I'll be back tomorrow.
## Day 5: Tuesday, 01/05/2021

**Time Spent:** 1h45m

**Today's Progress**

- I explored reactive statements/variables and implemented a solution to my dynamic filtering
- More import/export issues came up with different prop types, so I had to extract each one into its own file
- I also updated my sample data points to provide more diversity

**Thoughts:** It's getting harder to do an extra hour of coding after the work day. Reactivity statements can be quite powerful! I like them.

## Day 4: Monday, 01/04/2021

**Time Spent:** 1h

**Today's Progress**

- Refactor the search functionality into a separate component.
- Cleanup some of the old code.
- Add Chips (Tags) for meal types.
- Pick a new name: Z's Next Meal Planner

**Thoughts:** Doing 1 hour of coding after a long work day is not as easy as it seemed. I dabbled with some forms today, but decided against using them for now. I'll need to come up with a good way of filtering data at multiple levels.

## Day 3: Sunday, 01/03/2021

**Time Spent:** 1h25m

**Today's Progress**

- I learned about Svelte Material UI and integrated it with my random selector project
- Started using Card, TextField and some other Material components to make the app look better

**Thoughts:** Setting up Material UI for Svelte with my setup was a bit of a challenge. I had to install `rollup-plugin-postcss` and `node-sass` and make updates to the rollup.config.js. Also, I need to create a basic theme `src/theme/smui-theme.scss`. I found out that I can't use CSS classes on Components in Svelte so I had to resort to other tricks to get a meal card appear selected on click.

## Day 2: January 2, 2021

**Time Spent:** 1h30m

**Today's Progress**

- I spent some time in the Svelte documentation to learn more about:
    - Scaffolding a new project
    - Reactivity rules
    - Svelte REPL ([readâ€“evalâ€“print loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop))
    - The Rollup module bundler
- Followed a tutorial for setting up a full stack app with Svelte and Express.
- Started working on a random meal selector app.
- Created the basic data structure for the meals, types, a display card.

**Thoughts:** Running Svelte and Express together was pretty easy. I was able to setup the whole thing and get a basic route running in under 30 minutes. I had some trouble exporting/importing types with Typescript in Svelte. In the end I was able to figure it out and it made sense the way it works. I used what I learned yesterday in setting up the new app.

## Day 1: January 1, 2021

**Time Spent:** 1h30m

**Today's Progress**

- Created a simple Todo App with Svelte based on a tutorial from coding CodingTheSmartWay.
- Made the following enhancements:
    - Moved the todo data in a JSON file that loads when the component is mounted
    - Updated some of the styling for the cursor pointer and the way the input and the todo labels were handled
    - Switched out some uses of forEach() with map()
    - Cleaned up the code
    - Enable Typescript and add basic types

**Thoughts:** The code for the Todo App was fairly simple and easy to understand.

## Day 0: January 1, 2021

**Time Spent:** 30m

**Today's Progress**

- Went over the rules and guidelines for the 100 days of code challenge.
- Forked the Log repo and started my own log.
- Came up with a list of goals:
    - Learn Svelte by building sample projects.
    - Improve React.js skills by building sample projects.
    - Learn and experiment with server side rendering frameworks and technologies.
    - Work on a personal project idea about building habits.

**Thoughts:** I'm trying to get into the habit of learning and experimenting with technologies, tools and frameworks that I don't get to use in my day-to-day work. This sounds like a good way of achieving that goal. This is sprint 0. Let's see how things go. I don't know how I feel about tweeting about this challenge every day though.
