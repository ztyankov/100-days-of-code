The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on *[January 1, Friday, 2021]*.

#### ⚡ I will code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days

## Day 2: January 2, 2021

**Time Spent:** 1h30m

**Today's Progress**

- I spent some time in the Svelte documentation to learn more about:
    - Scaffolding a new project
    - Reactivity rules
    - Svelte REPL ([read–eval–print loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop))
    - The Rollup module bundler
- Followed a tutorial for setting up a full stack app with Svelte and Express.
- Started working on a random meal selector app.
- Created the basic data structure for the meals, types, a display card.

**Thoughts:**

## Day 1: January 1, 2021

**Time Spent:** 1h30m

**Today's Progress**

- Created a simple Todo App with Svelte based on a tutorial from coding CodingTheSmartWay.
- Made the following enhancements:
    - Moved the todo data in a JSON file that loads when the component is mounted
    - Updated some of the styling for the cursor pointer and the way the input and the todo labels were handled
    - Switched out some uses of forEach() with map()
    - Cleaned up the code
    - Enable Typescript and add basic types

**Thoughts:** The code for the Todo App was fairly simple and easy to understand.

## Day 0: January 1, 2021

**Time Spent:** 30m

**Today's Progress**

- Went over the rules and guidelines for the 100 days of code challenge.
- Forked the Log repo and started my own log.
- Came up with a list of goals:
    - Learn Svelte by building sample projects.
    - Improve React.js skills by building sample projects.
    - Learn and experiment with server side rendering frameworks and technologies.
    - Work on a personal project idea about building habits.

**Thoughts:** I'm trying to get into the habit of learning and experimenting with technologies, tools and frameworks that I don't get to use in my day-to-day work. This sounds like a good way of achieving that goal. This is sprint 0. Let's see how things go. I don't know how I feel about tweeting about this challenge every day though.
