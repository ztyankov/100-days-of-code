# 100 Days of Code - Log - Zdravko Tyankov

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on *[January 1, Friday, 2021]*.

#### âš¡ I will code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days

## Day 0: January 1, 2021

**Time Spent:** 1h

**Today's Progress**

- Went over the rules and guidelines for the 100 days of code challenge.
- Forked the Log repo and started my own log.
- Came up with a list of goals:
    - Learn Svelte by building sample projects.
    - Improve React.js skills by building sample projects.
    - Learn and experiment with server side rendering frameworks and technologies.
    - Work on a personal project idea about building habits.

**Thoughts:** This sounds like an interesting idea for building a habit. I don't know how I feel about tweeting about this challenge every day though.
